constraining time and resources, thus limiting downside, and building a minimum viable product to test your value
hypothesis as soon as possible with real customers should be applied at the start of every endeavor.

Whenever you hear of a new IT project starting up with a large budget, teams of tens or hundreds of people,
and a timeline of many months before something actually gets shipped, you can expect the project will go over time and
budget and not deliver the expected value.

Limiting initial investment and creating resource scarcity is essential to managing the risk of innovation.
Given that most innovative ideas we have will not succeed, we must come up with simple, quick experiments to eliminate
bad ideas rapidly and cheaply.

Our runway should be a list of hypotheses to test, not a list of requirements to build

I trusted the team, and gave them two things that Intel and Motorola had never given their people: the first was no
money and the second was no people. They had to keep it simple.

No major piece of work should be fully funded before we have evidence to support the business and economic model on which it is based,
and this exploration must be done with small, cross-functional teams with a limited runway, as described in Part II

an important factor in the success of the Lean Startup approach is to limit the size of the explore team and the resources available to them (including time).
This encourages people to apply their creativity and focus on learning rather than pursuing “perfect” solutions.
There are no awards for elegance of software design or automated test coverage in an MVP — the more skeletal, the better,
provided we can gather the information we need.

There are two practices that should be adhered to from the beginning that will allow us to pay down technical debt later on:
continuous integration and a small number of basic unit and user-journey tests.
The moment a product (if we are in Horizon 3) or feature (in Horizon 2) goes from being an experiment to validated,
we need to start aggressively paying down technical debt.
Typically that means adding more user-journey tests, employing good architectural practices such as modularization,
and making sure all new code written on the feature uses test-driven development (good engineers will already use TDD).

we must then pull the lever hard in the other direction, kill the momentum, and transition our focus from building the right thing to building the thing right.

The final — and too often forgotten — members of the team are customers and users.
It is easy to fall into the trap of seeing them as simply a consumer of the solution we have created.
In fact, they are critical stakeholders.
