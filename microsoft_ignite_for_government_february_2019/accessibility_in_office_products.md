# Accessibility in office products to increase inclusivity in your organization


- accessibility is built into all products; it's not a bolted on feature you pay money for
- 

## Ease of Access settings

- these are the settings built into the windows 10 operating system
- they make updates to these periodically
- stuff in the left sidebar is ordered from most frequently used to least frequently
- NOTE: this is different from "Ease of access center" in the control panel! I learned this the hard way, when I clicked on ease of access center during this presentation and when it opened, my computer started talking. Whoops. How awkward.

## Edge Accessibility

- xbox adaptive controller -- this is the thing that was in the recent super bowl controller. 
- in Edge, the "reading view" which is in the address bar can make content easier to read on a web page; she's using the xbox adaptive controller web page to demo the reading view... it's a remarkable difference. It's highly customizable. You can increase text spacing which helps dyslexic people a lot, apparently; "line focus" for focusing on just a few lines at a time. Under "grammar tools" you can even have words divided up by syllables, and different highlight colors for different parts of speech
- you can also have Edge pages read out loud to you. This is under "Read Aloud". You can change the voice and speed
- Apparently this is all available in different office products as well

## "Create Confidently"


this is in MS Word

- spell check now has "synonyms" under spelling choices to help you know whether the spelling you're choosing is actually the word you mean
- In the office ribbon, there are 3000 little buttons available. Nobody, not even the office engineering team, knows where they all are; so now they have a search feature for actions; for example, you highlight text and then go into the search box and type "bold" it'll help you find the bold action. This reminds me a lot of the stuff in Intellij Idea, Eclipse, and VS Code
- there's a "dictate" feature. You click the microphone button and you talk and it types; she says this can even be useful for notetaking in meetings or for when you're speaking a mile a minute to get the ideas out and want to be sure to capture it all
- she says it's *not* trained to your voice. it just picks up all the voices, so in meetings it might be useful for when one person is talking to just get snippets of what someone is saying
- accessibility checker: she recommends using this on docs and emails before sending. It's under the "review" ribbon. It shows you all the things to fix, why, and what to fix. I tried this out on my copy of word during this preso and it's pretty cool. She shows an example of photos and how it'll analyze the photo and recommend alt text, and this is really rad! 

Powerpoint

- she says there's a way to use powerpoint to make it look like you've spent hours on your slides
  - she starts by inserting several pictures from her computer
  - then powerpoint shows her this "design idea" thing in the right hand side; it automatically makes the slide accessible, and the design options provide different styling on the photos like a circle filter, all automatically. Pretty slick.
- she shows another example where she creates a slide and adds some dates, and the "design ideas" automatically creates a timeline-style slide she might use. OK, this is rad for lazy people like me ;)

- the "translator" tool -- you can be speaking, and it can auto translate and provide subtitles
- there's a translate app on your phone; if you start up your preso and enable translations/subitltes, and then you can pull up the translate app on your phone and scan the QR code that the presentation provides, and it'll provide those translations customized for your language. So every attendee can have customized translations appear on their phone. She demos this , and it is very cool
- OK, again, holy shit this is cool. Obviously I have no idea how accurate it is, but still, very cool that it even does this at all. The QR code way of doing this is really neat, assuming the QR code that is presented on the screen is big enought hat everyone in the room can capture it on their phone. The one she's showing is pretty big; I just have no idea how well phones do this from far away


Office Lens

- "organize efficiently"
- for example, you take a picture of something, and it stores on your computer or uploads to onenote; it'll analyze the picture and basically make it searchable
- she shows an example of using this app on her phone to take a  picture of an upside down document; the app is smart enough to know it's upside down, know it's not fully in view, and the app speaks to her to tell her what to do. She then takes a picture of the app, it scans the picture, converts it to text and can even read the whole document to you

"Seeing AI"
- an app you can put on your phone that can help interpret the world around you. 
- she's telling how this is useful for blind people

"Soundscape"
- app that analyzes the sounds around you and lets you know what's going on

All these apps are free; again, MS is focused on having these technologies not cost people money. that is part of being inclusive
