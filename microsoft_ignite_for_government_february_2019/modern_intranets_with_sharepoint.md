Modern Intranet with Sharepoint
--------------------------------

huh... this room is packed. probably the most packed session I've been in so far

Just go get her slides... I'll take notes on the highlight reel

- when planning an intranet, focus on the big business outcomes, not whether it's pretty or keeps people awake. an intranet needs to help people do their jobs. don't do gratuitous stuff
- find the "big rocks" in the org. you do that by talking with users. you don't build an intranet for users, you build it with them
- get analytics on your *current* intranet to see what people are using
- Her message is very utilitarian
- don't ask about the intranet... ask about the work. she says this is how you should always think, not even for an intranet. "the difference between a developer and a consultant is that a developer can't wait to code and will always say yes when you ask them to build something". ha.
- observe users where they work. you'll never get the answers you need by asking them on the phone
- she thinks one of the most important jobs of a modern intranet is to build community and culture
- says that people profiles are a key here; also ability to roll up "events" (whatever that means); yammer praise and posts, and sharepoint news stories
- she's saying that yammer is really important for building communities of practice; start a CoP with a yammer community, and then build a sharepoint communications site for that CoP. This all sounds extremely similar to what we had at booz allen 9 years ago
- "Stream": a youtube-like way to create youtube like videos for how to do things in your org. she says think of it as your internal youtube channel
- she says all these tools are 100% mobile out of the box, unlike having to mobile-ize your current internal thing
- EDITORIAL: all of this is making me think about the LEAD act and its provisions for Intranets; seems like this all checks those boxes
- more EDITORIAL: I used yammer back at booz. Based on what I know of it back then, I have a hard time seeing how you'd want to use it instead of teams. How has teams not killed yammer?
- For day-to-day activities, I see "Flow" and "PowerApps" for tasks and approvals; these came up yesterday too and reminds me a bit of the outlook session with Actionable Messages and the bot session which was all about interacting with a bot to get stuff done
- importance of really good search; apparently all of this stuff has really good search
- she says that most users start with "browse", not search, but search still important
- she says that with search results, the way this stuff works is that humans can only ever see stuff they have access to; search results will never return things in search that you can't see; But humans can still add links to documents inside an intranet page, for example, and obviously it can't hide that link
- says that Training for building and using an intranet like this will require training, especially around the best practices she's talking about with respect to sharing files and whatnot
- says the first thing to think about when planning a modern intranet is Governance: "what are we going to allow". And these decisions should not be made by IT alone; they should be made in concert with the business. If you do it alone with IT, you'll just end up with shadow IT. If you lock things down without considering the needs of the business, users will find a way to do what they need to do
- tiny.cc/SharePointGovQuestions and tiny.cc/SPGovStepbyStep to help you get started with the kinds of questions to ask about governance
- recommends a small (4-5 people) core team to spearhead these governance conversations and then bring in experts & such for targeted discussions
- Help users adopt with "examples", not "workloads", i.e. what are you trying to accomplish?
- a governance plan is not a document; it should be a site with governance content, wrapped in training. This is a communications site. That "stepbystep" link above shows how to do it
- she's talking about the problems with organizational hierarchy based information architecture; the big problem being "what happens when you have a re-org?". "The one thing I know about your organization is that it will change"
- she says modern site architectures are "flat"... everybody / every unit of work gets a "site collection". She says the modern admin center has great tools for managing this, so don't get overwhelmed by the idea of sprawl
- "Hub sites" are effectively families of sites that help you group related sites, i.e. "HR Hub" (functional example), "Inside Austria" (this is a geographic example)
- aka.ms/PlanningSPhubsites
- using hub sites apparently prevents breaking links when things change
- "Mega Menus" are starting to roll out now from microsoft; you never know when your tenant will get it
- she says a "modern intranet is all about ME"... when I come to a home page, it's targeted to me. She says a lot of this is already here in Office 365, a lot is coming, and the rest you can build it
- "SharePoint Home" is an "all about me" type of thing
- also have "Personalizable Web Parts". this is out of the box... recent sites for the current users, recent docs for the current users, news targeted based on audience (this one is rolling out soon)
- she is now showing some example intranets. Funko Inc has a cool one
-github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit has some cool starter kit stuff for personalizing email, tasks, calendar, contacts
- Wavemaker Global... they don't even call it an intranet, they call it a "work hub". 100% personalized intranet home page
- you can also buy third party capabilities to plug in to your intranet if it doesn't come out of the box and if it'd be more expensive to build it yourself
- look up sharepoint-intranets-in-a-box report 2019

- when you buy into the cloud, you need to plan for change, at launch and ongoing
- you need to pay attention to what's on the microsoft roadmap for these products; know what's coming down the pike
- you probably need a change management team, and you should build a champions program for your Intranet

Lessons from the award-winning intranets
- make it easy for individual site owners to do the right thing
  - page layout templates
  - library of examples guidelines and standards
- provide training for content authors and site owners
  - MS custom learning for office 365 (coming)
  - custom governance and training for your org... consult that "step by step" link above
  - you need training that isn't just "reading stuff". people learn in different ways and need different types of ways into this content
  - don't ditch the training part of your budget
- establish a support community
  - intranet champions (with a yammer community)

Her calls to action:
- understand your big rocks -- align initiatives with those big rocks
- plan first, especially around governance.
- think about the story your intranet is telling: know your readers... use terms they'll understand
- it's their story -- personalize it
- have a change team, plan for change, and communicating about change
- learn more: aka.ms/SharePoint-build-modern-intranet
- Your intranet is never done; it's always going to need to change
