# Microsoft Ignite for Government -- February 2019

Monday morning notes
  - Check out VS Code "Live Share"
    - I tried this out later... really easy to get set up, and it uses a secure shared tunnel to communicate
    - you can share with up to 5 people at a time
    - Could be a great solution for remote pairing, which we've been looking for since our previous go-to solution got acquired by Slack and then went away
