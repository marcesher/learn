He has all this stuff on slides, so I'm not duplicating them

- ftrace: can trace nearly any kernel function
- kprobes and uprobes
- sysdig: easy to use, but not as powerful as other tools
- perf: right in the middle of ease of use and power
  - there are frontends on top of perf to make it a little easier to use
  
- bpf / bcc: hard to use, super powerful

- he says he'll spend the most time on bpf / bcc b/c they're newer and you need to learn them
