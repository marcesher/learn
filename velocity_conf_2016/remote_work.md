Remote: "if you're at the office, you're in a hotel"
  - if you come into the office, you are captive
  
  
Remote is not working from home one day a week

On meetings: if you're remote, don't work during the meeting. Either be present, or leave

Leading a distributed team:

- he currently has people in 9 time zones
- applied lessons he learned from open source
- 1:1 meetings are sacred
  - only exception is if one person is out all week
  - if there's at least one day a week where both are there, the 1:1 gets rescheduled
- remove private chat channels
  - doesn't like private rooms b/c it's more likely people will talk shit on others / other teams
- his job as manager is to provide context for all the work going on
  - writes an email of everything he noticed for the week
  - things he learned in meetings, etc
  - encourages the team to send back with things they learned from meetings
  
The Quick Chat

- quick 5 minute video call can get a lot taken care of
  - get out of email, chat, etc
  
Team hangout

- get together on video chat, and just work
- alternate the time it happens, in different weeks
- optional

Regroups

- he thinks once a quarter is great

Performance evaluation

- his style is to load people up with so much work until they say "this is too much"
- because he doesn't know how fast people can do a particular thing
- he puts it in the employee's court to push back on the work

Lieutenant in the office

- delegate with authority, and he'll back them up


Difficulty bringing in entry level folks

- he finds it really hard to bring in entry level folks on distributed teams
- he hasn't figured out how to bring in junior folks on remote teams and help them be successful


Summary

- being distributed reinforces the best management behaviors

Company

- company needs to invest in tech for remote people
- record output from meetings
  - record meetings themsevles if necessary
- dashboards need to be viewable by people not in the office


Recognition

- if you can recognize them on all-hands when they did something great, do it
- care packages... stuff people in the office get but you don't
